 Ultimate Calender / To-Do list / Organizer application: manage.

Initial Idea:
Maintaining productivity is difficult over long periods of time, due to the 
many distractions we allow ourselves to be susceptible to. I tend to make lists 
in multiple formats; in my notebook, on my desk planner on my phone - but theres
no way to access these multiple lists if I do not have all three mediums on me
at the same time. I want to make an application which will combine all of these 
mediums into one place. To-Do lists as well as notes, all organized nicely with 
an adjoining calendar. It'll be like all the lists you've made on paper and the 
notes you make on google keep all together synced with a vastly improved google 
calendar - all inside "manage."

Command line planning:
Read the command the user typed in
Is the command valid (e.g. 'Hack' is not a command but 'add' is)
Is the format of the command valid (e.g. cant just type add) - correct num of args
Is the command semantically correct (e.g. add task "help" to todo1 - but todo1 doesn't exist)
Now execute the command and repeat
